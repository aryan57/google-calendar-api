# google-calendar-api

Codechef and Codeforces have a google calendar for their contests,\
However Atcoder doesn't have one.\
(Actually they have, but they dont't update it regularly).\

So I made a google calendar for the Programming Contests in (atcoder.jp) using API.\
I tried 3 languages , all 3 work.
