This API Google Calendar is made using Google Script .
I used Google Apps Script for this.

Steps : 
1) Make a script project in Google Script (script.google.com).
2) Copy the code.
3) Create a new calendar and Add the Calendar Id in the code.
4) Deploy the project as a web app.

Note :
Open the link given for testing (having /dev at the end) occasionaly to update the calendar.

Benefit :
No need to pay for any hosting fees on GCP,AWS etc. :)
Its 100% free.
