This API Google Calendar is made using Google Script . \
I used Google Apps Script for this.

Steps : 
1) Make a new script in script.google.com
2) Copy paste the code in Code.gs to it.
3) Get your `CALENDAR_ID` by making a new calendar in [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com/calendar).
4) Get your `USER_NAME` and `API_KEY` by making a account in [clist.by](https://clist.by/)
5) Add an hourly time based trigger in your appscript, so it gets updated hourly.


Benefit :\
App Script is completely free :)
